# casual-classifier-KNN-BFMatch-
Here, a flann based knn matcher using sift extractor and brute force feature matcher is demonstrated using the training image/ template as the jackfruit. Different images of fruits are given as an input and the output is shown as a result of good matches. The key points and their descriptors are found using the orb detector.
